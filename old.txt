### Title: Enhancing Optimization with Parallelized Genetic Algorithms

#### Introduction:
Genetic Algorithms (GAs) emulate the process of natural selection to solve complex optimization problems. Parallelizing GAs leverages multiple cores, aiming to expedite the convergence of solutions.

#### Purpose:
This study investigates the impact of parallelization on Genetic Algorithms by examining execution times across different core counts, aiming to enhance the efficiency of optimization processes.

#### Significance:
Optimization problems are prevalent in various fields, demanding efficient solutions. Parallelizing GAs could potentially offer substantial time savings and resource optimization.

#### Relevance:
In the era of multi-core processors, harnessing parallel computing capabilities becomes pivotal. Understanding the relationship between core counts and performance aids in optimizing algorithms for speed and efficiency.

#### Hypothesis:
Increasing core counts will linearly reduce execution times, facilitating faster convergence of Genetic Algorithms in optimization tasks.

#### Methods:
Utilizing MATLAB's Parallel Computing Toolbox, a Genetic Algorithm was implemented to minimize the sum of squares of a 10-variable problem.

#### Algorithms & Terminologies:
Genetic Algorithms evolve a population of potential solutions through selection, crossover, and mutation operations across multiple generations.

#### Results and Analysis:

##### Execution Times:
- **2 cores:** Execution time: 80.5493s
- **4 cores:** Execution time: 35.7826s
- **6 cores:** Execution time: 39.7006s
- **8 cores:** Execution time: 41.9951s
- **10 cores:** Execution time: 39.8404s
- **12 cores:** Execution time: 39.1971s

#### Efficiency and Speedup Analysis:

##### Speedup:
Speedup is calculated as the ratio of the execution time on a single core to the execution time on multiple cores.
- **Speedup (2 cores):** 1x (baseline)
- **Speedup (4 cores):** 2.25x
- **Speedup (6 cores):** 2.03x
- **Speedup (8 cores):** 1.92x
- **Speedup (10 cores):** 2.02x
- **Speedup (12 cores):** 2.05x

##### Efficiency:
Efficiency represents the speedup achieved per added core and is calculated as Speedup divided by the number of cores used.
- **Efficiency (2 cores):** 50%
- **Efficiency (4 cores):** 56.25%
- **Efficiency (6 cores):** 33.83%
- **Efficiency (8 cores):** 24%
- **Efficiency (10 cores):** 20.2%
- **Efficiency (12 cores):** 17.08%

#### Observations:
- **Efficiency:** Decreases as core count increases, indicating diminishing returns per added core.
- **Speedup:** Non-linear relationship between cores and speedup due to parallelization overhead and resource contention.

#### Potential Improvements:
- Optimization of GA parameters for parallel execution.
- Profiling to identify and address bottlenecks affecting parallel efficiency.
- Utilizing advanced parallel computing strategies to minimize overhead.

#### Implications:
Parallelized GAs showcase potential for faster optimization, but their efficiency varies with core counts. The diminishing returns per added core stress the need for balanced utilization of resources.

#### Conclusion:
Parallelized Genetic Algorithms offer accelerated optimization but necessitate a careful balance between core utilization and system constraints. Understanding the intricacies of parallel efficiency aids in optimizing algorithm performance.

This study illuminates the significance of parallelization in optimization algorithms, underscoring the need for nuanced resource management to maximize efficiency in parallel Genetic Algorithm implementations.
